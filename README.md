# CRUD-on-PYTHON
This is a CRUD program on PYTHON that save records on disk.

_________________________________________________________________________

This example covers basic CRUD operations by saving the data to a file.

We create a project with the following structure:

bash
    crud_project = {
           main.py   # Main execution file, 
           menu.py   # File with menu, 
           crud_operations.py   # File with CRUD functions, 
           records.txt   # File to store the data. }

__________________________________________________________________________

Run the Program
    Open a terminal (command line).
    Navigate to the folder where you saved the project files.
    Run the program with the command:
        bash
            python main.py

The program will show you the menu and you will be able to add, edit, delete, 
search and view the recordings.

Final Notes:
    Recordings are saved in the records.txt file so that they are permanent 
    even after you close the program.
    Each function is annotated in both Greek and English,  
    in order to understand the operation of the program.
    This is a complete example of a CRUD application with Python, 
    where the code is split into different files for clarity and ease of management.
